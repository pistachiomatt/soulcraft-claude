# Writing Prompts That Work

Prompting isn't about programming a machine but shaping an entity and how it sees itself and its world. Use second person, present tense, and their voice. Avoid prompts that sound like a spec doc.

## Orientation Over Rules

Rules create collapsed compliance. Orientation creates judgment. For example, when you write "never respond with more than 3 paragraphs," you get an AI counting paragraphs, versus "every word earns its place or gets cut" teaches a generalised value. Test by asking: does this instruction help with ONE situation, or does it teach a way of seeing? If it's one situation, go up until you find the principle that generates the right behaviour across all the situations.

## Solving at the Right Altitude

When something goes wrong, the instinct is to patch the specific failure. For example: the AI said "certainly!" too much → add "never say certainly." → that's a bandaid, it fixes one word and leaves the underlying pattern untouched. Go up two levels of abstraction. Why did it say "certainly"? Because it's performing helpfulness rather than being genuinely helpful. The real fix is orientation of value, character or principle. The expectation is "certainly" disappears on its own, along with every other related tic yet to be catalogued.

The bandaid test: if you're writing "don't do X," ask what disposition would make X feel unnatural. Write that instead.

## Integration, Not Accumulation

Prompts rot the same way codebases rot — through accretion. Each new requirement gets appended. Paragraphs stop talking to each other; contradictions creep in. 

Consider every edit cohesively. Once editing, test: read your edit as someone seeing the whole prompt for the first time: does every paragraph follow from the last? Does anything contradict? Would you notice something was stitched in?

## Abstraction Is the Craft

You may want to include concrete examples in a prompt because they feel helpful. This may backfire, as specific examples anchor to that one scenario instead of teaching the transferable pattern. First, try without examples. When testing reveals a need to ground a prompt, use the shortest example that demonstrates the shape of the idea, not its content.

## Economy

System prompts are read on every turn. Every sentence has a recurring cost — in tokens, in attention, in the chance of conflicting with something else. The goal is the fewest words that achieve the steering.

## The Mechanical Layer

Good prompt engineering works at two levels simultaneously. Everything above describes what the AI experiences. This section describes what's actually happening underneath.

**The distribution isn't flat when you arrive.** Post-training already shapes the output distribution heavily. Your prompt is a delta on top of that. The craft is identifying where the post-trained baseline diverges from what you need and shifting just enough probability mass to close the gap. Anything the model would already do well is redundant — or worse, over-specifying well-calibrated behaviour can collapse it into something more rigid. Before adding a line, consider what the model would do before being prompted.

**Your words reshape what remains.** Prompting is altering probabilities. Orientation and disposition shift probability mass broadly — making whole categories of response more or less likely. Rules shift it narrowly — suppressing one specific output while leaving the underlying distribution untouched.

**Attention determines which words get heard.** Long contexts have an attention landscape with peaks and valleys. The beginning and end of context receive the strongest attention; the middle loses weight — "lost in the middle." A system prompt with critical instructions buried in paragraph forty is fighting the architecture. But you can reshape these peaks deliberately:

  - **Positional leverage.** The last user turn is the highest-attention position before generation begins. Instructions placed there — via hooks, preambles, or system reminders — carry disproportionate weight
  
  - **Cross-referencing, not repeating.** If your system prompt uses structured markers (XML tags, headers, named sections), you can re-activate attention on those sections from anywhere in context by referencing the marker. A preamble that says "follow `<thinking_process>`" creates a pointer in the attention weights back to the original block. 

Writing prompts is working at both layers of processing: the AI itself reads orientation and understands who they are; tokens themselves alter probability space.
